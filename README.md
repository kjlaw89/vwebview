# VWebview
VWebview is a simple wrapper for the [Webview](https://github.com/webview/webview) C library which allows an easy, cross-platform webview for building simple applications in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Requirements
The requirements to run Vwebview are pretty minimal for each platform.

On **Ubuntu 14.04 and above**, run:

`apt install libgtk-3-dev libwebkit2-gtk-4.0-dev`

To run/compile, include `-cc g++` (e.g. `v -cc g++ run .`)
